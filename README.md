# SleepyPiPlayer

* play audiobooks as MP3-file when falling asleep
* permanent always-active automatic sleep-timer -> shutdown after some minutes
* based on raspberry-pi with powerbank and USB-soundcard
* audio-feedback instead of a display
* real tactile keys can be pressed without glasses in complete darkness
* easy operation without menus and sub-menus
* minimum number of key-presses required in standard use-case

## problems with standard MP3-players

* In most cases, you need to activate the sleep-timer each time you start the playback.
* Activating the sleep-timer is hidden in some sub-menu.
* You do not wear glasses in bed. Activating the sleep-timer is a problem.
* Smartphone-apps can not be used without glasses.
* Changing the playback position by a few minutes requires complicated interaction.
